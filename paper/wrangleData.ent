Here,
``available
data''
refers
to
existing
data
sources
that
contain
information
relevant
to
the
variable
of
interest.
Although
some
comparisons
can
proceed
without
complete
data
coverage,
analyses
based
on
incomplete
information
risk
producing
misleading
conclusions
(see,
e.g.,
\citeproc
{ref-SoltEtAl2016}{Solt
et
al.
2016},
\citeproc
{ref-SoltEtAl2017}{2017}).
Therefore,
the
sufficiency
of
data
is
often
closely
tied
to
the
(external)
validity
of
comparisons.

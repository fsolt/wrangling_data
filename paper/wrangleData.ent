Here,
``available
data''
refers
to
existing
data
sources
that
contain
information
relevant
to
the
variable
of
interest.
Although
some
comparisons
can
proceed
without
complete
data
coverage,
analyses
based
on
incomplete
information
risk
producing
misleading
conclusions
(see,
e.g.,
\citeproc
{ref-SoltEtAl2016}{Solt
et
al.
2016},
\citeproc
{ref-SoltEtAl2017}{2017}).
Therefore,
the
sufficiency
of
data
is
often
closely
tied
to
the
(external)
validity
of
comparisons.

Note
that
harmonizing
aggregate
data,
as
in
SWIID,
and
survey
data,
as
in
DCPO,
involves
different
specific
challenges.
Aggregate
data
require
consistent
measurement
and
scaling
across
sources,
whereas
survey
data
require
conceptual
and
semantic
alignment
of
questions
and
response
options.
We
use
the
two
cases
to
illustrate
how
our
TAO
routine
can
benefit
diverse
data
harmonization
missions.

title:  "A TAO for Data Wrangling:  A Practical Routine for Getting Past the 'Janitor Work'"
subtitle: Memo to Editor and Reviewers
---


Thank you for the opportunity to revise our manuscript. 
We appreciate the insightful and constructive feedback from both reviewers and the editors. 
Below, we summarize how we have addressed each of the key suggestions.

**Clarifications and Terminology**
Both reviewers and the editors commented on terms and phrases that could benefit from clearer definitions. 
In this revised version, we have refined the framing and added explanations where needed.

In particulary, following Reviewer 1's (R1) suggestion, we now clarify the distinction between survey and aggregate data and explain their harmonization process in greater detail (see p. XXXX). 
We also added the term *“retrospective data harmonization”* alongside *“ex-post data harmonization”* to ensure that readers familiar with either expression can follow our discussion (see p. XXXX).

**Expanded Literature Review**
We thank Reviewer 2 (R2) for highlighting additional relevant scholarship on data harmonization. 
We have now incorporated these works to engage with the broader literature in this new version (see p. XXXX).

**Further Validation of Step 2**
We appreciate R2's observation that while automation in Step 2 of our routine helps reduce errors associated with manual data entry, it cannot fully eliminate all possible mistakes. 
The revised version now explicitly acknowledges this limitation (see p. XXXX).

We also thank the editor for noting the connection between our discussion and other contributions in this symposium regarding software usage. 
We have incorporated this work into the manuscript (see p. XXXX).

Finally, **Polishing and Readability**
We are grateful for the editors' and reviewers' suggestions to further improve the manuscript's clarity and framing. 
The revised version has been thoroughly edited and proofread. 
If any parts remain unclear, we will gladly make further revisions.

Thank you again for your careful reading and valuable feedback.
